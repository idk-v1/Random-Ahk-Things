# Random-Ahk-Things
A collection of the more useful things I have made instead of working in class

For the AmogusMaker.exe, run it in a program like ms paint in a full window, otherwise it could mess up your desktop organization or worse. It draws an crewmate. Hotkey is ctrl + 4
The Pythag.exe is a pythagorean theorum calculator. (Sorry for bad spelling, there is a reason it is just called "Pythag").
Txt2Htm_v5_1.exe is literally a worse version of word that only does text. It has one redeeming feature: It has no upper limit for text size.
For the @stu.cpsk12.org.exe, the hotkey is alt+1 up.
